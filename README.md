### âœ¨ Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work at Google. I occasionally work on personal projects here.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - https://keybase.io/bogosian
  - Create an issue like [this one](https://github.com/bogosj/bogosj/issues/1) in [my profile repo](https://github.com/bogosj/bogosj/issues).
    - If you'd like, encrypt the message with [age](http://age-encryption.org) using the public key `age1xtx3smv56a8tf7de2q0gxz3zmuw6pyj9mrul0l5jpmxmfnzawd9qylfm6f`. Use `-a` for a PEM encoded output.
    - I made a [Docker image](https://github.com/users/bogosj/packages/container/age) for the age binaries. [Dockerfile](https://github.com/bogosj/docker-age/blob/main/Dockerfile)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- As of 2020-10-11 my commits should be signed by either Github's web key, or 7EDA685B3C0ED22C42A70FF0D6DEAEF8FBE2726A.
